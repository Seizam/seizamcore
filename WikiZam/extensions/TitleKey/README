This extension provides case-insensitive matches for a few points in
MediaWiki's functionality:

* "go" exact title matches
* Prefix-based searches in OpenSearch (Firefox plugin) and internal AJAX searches

It does not provide complete case-insensitivity for title linking within the wiki.


== Database schema ==

A 'titlekey' table is added to the wiki's database, which maintains a case-folded
copy of each page's title. This is then binary-indexed for matching and sorting.

The table must be present for the wiki to function once the extension is enabled,
and it must be populated for the title match functions to pick up matches.


== Installation ==

To enable the extension, add the following line to your LocalSettings.php file:

  include "$IP/extensions/TitleKey/TitleKey.php";


You must then create and populate the new database table.

The easiest way to do this is to run MediaWIki's standard updaters:

  php maintenance/update.php


If you do not have command-line access to your server, you can manually
apply the titlekey.sql file's commands to your database (check for proper
table prefix, etc).


== Repopulating the titlekey table ==

The titlekey table can be repopulated by hand by running the rebuildTitleKeys.php
command-line script.
