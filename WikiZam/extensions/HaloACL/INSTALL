Installation:
=============
Note: If you use the bundled version of HaloACL, include the following in LocalSettings.php. Otherwise
      you must have already installed these extensions.

    require_once("extensions/ScriptManager/SM_Initialize.php");
    include_once('extensions/ARCLibrary/ARCLibrary.php');
    enableARCLibrary();

(1) Include the path to php.bin to the system variable PATH (either Windows or Linux), e.g. C:\xampp\php;
(2) Download and extract the HaloACL ZIP archive.
(3) Copy the folder 'HaloACL' into the extensions folder of MediaWiki.
(4) Activate the HaloACL by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:
	include_once('extensions/HaloACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php');
	enableHaloACL(); 
(5) Open a command prompt
(6) Go to the directory of HaloACL 
(7) Choose the command depending on your MediaWiki installation to patch MediaWiki:
		- MediaWiki 1.13.2
		   php patch.php -d <mediawiki-dir> -p patch_for_MW_1.13.2.txt
		- MediaWiki 1.15.1 and 1.15.2 
		   php patch.php -d <mediawiki-dir> -p patch_for_MW_1.15.1.txt
		- MediaWiki 1.15.3 
		   php patch.php -d <mediawiki-dir> -p patch_for_MW_1.15.3.txt
		- MediaWiki 1.16.0 or 1.16.1 
		   php patch.php -d <mediawiki-dir> -p patch_for_MW_1.16.0.txt
		- MediaWiki 1.16.4 
		   php patch.php -d <mediawiki-dir> -p patch_for_MW_1.16.4.txt
	
(8) Choose the command depending on your Semantic MediaWiki installation to patch SMW
	(skip this step if you don't have SMW installed). Replace <version> by the 
	version number of your SMW:
		- SMW <version> 
		   php patch.php -d <mediawiki-dir> -p patch_for_SMW_<version>.txt
		   
	
(9) Execute the following command to patch Semantic Forms (skip this step if you don't
	have the Semantic Forms extension installed). Replace <version> by the 
	version number of your Semantic Forms:
		php patch.php -d <mediawiki-dir> -p patch_for_SF_<version>.txt


* patch_for_MW_<version>.txt: 
	This patch for MediaWiki removes all links to protected pages from 
	the rendered articles and listings. If a link can not be removed, it is 
	replaced by a link to the page 'Permission denied'. This patch is optional.
* patch_for_SMW_<version>.txt: 
	This patch for SMW is mandatory, if you want to protect the values of 
	semantic properties.
* patch_for_SF_<version>.txt:
	This patch for Semantic Forms is mandatory, if you want to protect the 
	values of semantic properties in semantic forms and if you want to use the
	HaloACL toolbar in forms.

Updating the database
---------------------

The HaloACL extension requires some additional tables in the database that must
be added to the existing database schema. Existing data will not be modified.
Therefore change into the maintenance folder of the HaloACL extension and run the
setup script:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/HaloACL/maintenance
 php HACL_Setup.php
 
Creating default groups with default rights
-------------------------------------------
 
After the database is updated you can, if you want, create some default groups 
with default permissions:
 
Group                | Default permissions
---------------------------------------------
Knowledge consumer   | read
Knowledge provider   | read, edit, upload
Knowledge architect  | read, edit, manage, upload
sysop                | read, edit, manage, upload, administrate, technical
bureaucrat           | read, edit, manage, upload, administrate, technical

The user "WikiSysop" is the default member of these groups.

To create these defaults you have to execute the following on the command line:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/HaloACL/maintenance
 php HACL_Setup.php --initDefaults
 

Testing your Installation 
=========================

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see HaloACL (Version nn) listed under Other. 
Go to the Special:HaloACL to start defining access control lists.

Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in HACL_Initialize.php.

HaloACL with LDAP / ActiveDirectory support
===========================================
HaloACL can be connected to a LDAP or Active Directory server to use its structure
of groups and users. The extension "LdapAuthentication" is required for this. 
See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:LDAP_Authentication for further 
information.

Enabling LDAP support
---------------------

You have to set the variable $haclgBaseStore = HACL_STORE_LDAP, either in 
HACL_Initialize.php or in LocalSettings.php.

In LocalSettings.php it has to look like this:

include_once('extensions/HaloACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php');
$haclgBaseStore = HACL_STORE_LDAP;
enableHaloACL(); 

After that the extension LdapAuthentication has to be configured in LocalSettings.php.
The extension allows configuring the connection to several LDAP/ActiveDirectory
domains. The following example configuration shows one setting for an LDAP and an
Active Directory system, respectively. Of course, these settings will vary for
your system. Most variables originate from LdapAuthentication. Please refer to
its documentation for further information.

//--- LDAP/ActiveDirectory settings ---

require_once( "$IP/extensions/LdapAuthentication/LdapAuthentication.php" );
$wgAuth = new LdapAuthenticationPlugin();
$wgLDAPDomainNames = array( "LDAP", "ActiveDirectory" );
$wgLDAPServerNames = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => "localhost",
			"ActiveDirectory" => 'localhost' );
$wgLDAPSearchStrings = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => "cn=USER-NAME,ou=people,dc=company,dc=com",
			"ActiveDirectory" => "USER-NAME@xyz.company.com");
$wgLDAPSearchAttributes = array(
			"LDAP" => "cn",
			"ActiveDirectory"=>"sAMAccountName"  );
$wgLDAPGroupUseFullDN = array(
			"ActiveDirectory"=>true  );

//User and password used for proxyagent access.
//Please use a user with limited access, NOT your directory manager!
$wgLDAPProxyAgent = array(
			"ActiveDirectory"=>"CN=Wikisysop,OU=Users,OU=SMW,DC=xyz,DC=company,DC=com" );
$wgLDAPProxyAgentPassword = array(
			"ActiveDirectory"=>"test"  );

 	
$wgLDAPEncryptionType = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => "clear",
			"ActiveDirectory" => "clear");
$wgLDAPLowerCaseUsername = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => true,
			"ActiveDirectory" => true);

$wgLDAPBaseDNs =
	array(	'LDAP' => 'dc=company,dc=com',
			"ActiveDirectory" => 'OU=SMW,DC=xyz,DC=company,DC=com');
	
$wgLDAPUserBaseDNs =	
	array(	'LDAP'    => 'ou=people,dc=company,dc=com',
			"ActiveDirectory" => 'OU=Users,OU=SMW,DC=xyz,DC=company,DC=com');
$wgLDAPGroupBaseDNs =	
	array(	'LDAP'    => 'ou=groups,dc=company,dc=com',
			"ActiveDirectory" => 'OU=Groups,OU=SMW,DC=xyz,DC=company,DC=com');
	
//The objectclass of the groups we want to search for
$wgLDAPGroupObjectclass = 
	array("LDAP"     => "groupOfNames" ,
		  "ActiveDirectory" => "group");

//The attribute used for group members
$wgLDAPGroupAttribute = 
	array(	"LDAP"=>"member" ,
			"ActiveDirectory" => "member");

//The naming attribute of the group
$wgLDAPGroupNameAttribute = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => "cn" ,
			"ActiveDirectory" =>  "cn");
$wgLDAPGroupSearchNestedGroups = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => true ,
			"ActiveDirectory" => true);
$wgLDAPUseLDAPGroups = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => true ,
			"ActiveDirectory" => true);

//The objectclass of the users we want to search for
$wgLDAPUserObjectclass = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => "inetOrgPerson" ,
			"ActiveDirectory" => "person"); // only for HaloACL
$wgLDAPUserNameAttribute = 
	array(	"LDAP"    => "cn" ,
			"ActiveDirectory" => "samaccountname"); // only for HaloACL

Synchronizing users from the LDAP server
----------------------------------------
The UI shows the LDAP groups and their users. However, this is only possible if 
the users are really known to the wiki system. If a new LDAP server is connected 
to the wiki, unknown users will be displayed as 127.0.0.1  as unknown users 
default to localhost. The class HACLStorageLDAP  provides the utility method 
createUsersFromLDAP which creates a user account for each LDAP user in the wiki. 
The wiki administrator can invoke this function with the commandline script 
HACL_Setup.php in /extensions/HaloACL/maintenance/:

php HACL_Setup.php --createUsers --ldapDomain="Name of LDAP domain"

The Name of the LDAP domain is one of the domains that is specified in the LDAP 
configuration in LocalSettings.php.
